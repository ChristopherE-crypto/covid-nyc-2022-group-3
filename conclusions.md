# Conclusion to extended question

The best linear model for Manhattan has the following variables:
+ proportion of 18- to 64-years old who are uninsured
+ proportion of people who self-identified as white
+ median income

It has an adjusted r-squared of **40%**.

The best linear model for Queens has the following variables:
+ median income
+ proportion of population living in households with more than three inhabitants 
+ proportion of population using public transportation to commute to work that includes bus travel

It has an adjusted r-squared of **38%**.

We also added the change in mobility variable to these models. The linear model for Manhattan has an adjusted r-squared of **38%**. The linear model for Queens has an adjusted r-squared of **37%**.

For both counties, adding the change in mobility to both models decreased the adjusted r-squared. We can conclude that the change in mobility factor did not influence Covid positivity rate as much as the other variables.
